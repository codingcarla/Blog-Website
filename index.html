		<h2>A Dish is Worth A Thousand Words</h2>

		<p class="quote">The preparation and consumption of food provides, moreover, a material means for expressing the more abstract significance of social systems and cultural values.</p>  

		<p>It may be argued that what people are prepared to take inside their bodies reflects their social identities, and their membership of social groups.Food is very much a part of our private and social lives.</p>

		<h2>Cooking Is Life</h2>

		<p class="quote">If there is one thing that will not make me stressed, its cooking. I love just going over to the stove and making something that not only will take my stress away, but eat some delicious food as well.</p>

		<p>There are so many different types of food out there that there are endless possibilities of what you can cook. Whether it may be a different style, type, or even just a different version, there are endless possibilities.</p>

		<p>I know that some of my friends have either very little cooking experience or to much, that we all teach and learn one another. One friend I could teach one of my favorite recipes, and another friend could teach me her favorite recipe.</p>

		There are always different ingredients in your house that can be made into almost anything. Find a new dessert or dinner food based on what you have in the house and make a new creation.

		Whether you're with friends or family, or just cooking alone, there is always a certain joy in cooking, The satisfaction of having something that you just made with your own two hands, and then the compliments from other. Nothing beats that.</p>
